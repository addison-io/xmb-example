# Static Example of xmb-webkit

Static example output of xmb-webkit game launcher, this is for people interested in the HTML5 and JS aspects of the project only. When xmb-webkit runs, it generates HTML from your roms directory via Python. This example contains what you would expect from roms directory and media from [Skraper](https://www.skraper.net) (roms media scraper) and defined PC games. You can use an online version [here](https://addison-io.github.io/xmb-example/), though it's best to download and open index.html in Chrome. Normally  this is run locally using the file:// paths, it's modified to work for both web and locally.


# Updates

Since this runs perfectly for me and currently has no bugs I can find, this is a final release. It's also just an example of the full project; you will find feature improvements and updates in that repository if any are made.
